# **Financial Tracker 📊**  

## **Overview**  
The **Financial Tracker** is a simple Learning Project for TDD with Node.js.Here for practice we are building APIs that helps users track their income and expenses efficiently. It allows users to add transactions, 
retrieve them, update details, and delete transactions while maintaining an accurate balance.  

This project follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach using **Jest** to ensure reliability and correctness.  

## **Basic Features**  

✅ Add transactions (income/expense).  
✅ Retrieve all transactions or filter by date range.  
✅ Calculate the current balance (`total income - total expenses`).  
✅ Update an existing transaction.  
✅ Delete a transaction.  
✅ Proper validation and error handling.  

## **Tech Stack**  

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose)
